 event happens at the same I<local> time, regardless of where it
occurs.  See RFC 2445 for more details.

If the "name" parameter is "UTC", then a C<DateTime::TimeZone::UTC>
object is returned.

If the "name" is an offset string, it is converted to a number, and a
C<DateTime::TimeZone::OffsetOnly> object is returned.

=head3 The "local" time zone

If the "name" parameter is "local", then the module attempts to
determine the local time zone for the system.

The method for finding the local zone varies by operating system. See
the appropriate module for details of how we check for the local time
zone.

If a local time zone is not found, then an exception will be thrown.

=head2 $tz->offset_for_datetime( $dt )

Given a C<DateTime> object, this method returns the offset in seconds
for the given datetime.  This takes into account historical time zone
information, as well as Daylight Saving Time.  The offset is
determined by looking at the object's UTC Rata Die days and seconds.

=head2 $tz->offset_for_local_datetime( $dt )

Given a C<DateTime> object, this method returns the offset in seconds
for the given datetime.  Unlike the previous method, this method uses
the local time's Rata Die days and seconds.  This should only be done
when the corresponding UTC time is not yet known, because local times
can be ambiguous due to Daylight Saving Time rules.
