an array reference, while in list context it returns an array.

=head2 DateTime::TimeZone->countries()

Returns a sorted list of all the valid country codes (in lower-case)
which can be passed to C<names_in_country()>. In scalar context, it
returns an array reference, while in list context it returns an array.

If you need to convert country codes to names or vice versa you can
use C<Locale::Country> to do so.

=head2 DateTime::TimeZone->names_in_country( $country_code )

Given a two-letter ISO3166 country code, this method returns a list of
time zones used in that country. The country code may be of any
case. In scalar context, it returns an array reference, while in list
context it returns an array.

This list is returned in an order vaguely based on geography and
population. In general, the least used zones come last, but there are not
guarantees of a specific order from one release to the next. This order is
probably the best option for presenting zones names to end users.

=head2 DateTime::TimeZone->offset_as_seconds( $offset )

Given an offset as a string, this returns the number of seconds
