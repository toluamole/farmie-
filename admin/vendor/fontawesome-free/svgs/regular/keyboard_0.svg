Common Questions
----------------

Q: Will it run on [some platform]
A: If it is a *nix platform, it should without a problem.  If it's
   something different, probably not and your on your own if you
   want to try to make it work.

Q: When I compile, I get "file not found" errors?
A: Most likely, the compiler cant find the header files for one
   the required libraries.  If they are someplace other than the
   standard locations (ie: /usr/include), then you  probably need
   to specify an alternate location to look using one of the
   --with-<package> command line switches when you run configure,
   or edit the Makefile and specify the location with an '-I<path>'
   compiler flag.

Q: I get "libgd not found' errors?
A: You don't have the GD graphics located in a standard library
   path, or you don't have the GD graphics library at all.  If
   the later, go to http://www.boutell.com/gd/ and grab a copy.
   If you do have it, add a -L switch in the Makefile to point
   to the proper location.

Q: I get unresolved symbol errors when compiling, why?
A: This most often occurs when the GD library was built with
   additional support for such things as TrueType fonts or
   X11 graphics.  The configure script for The Webalizer only
   checks that the gd library is available, and does not check
   any other dependencies it may have.  Typically, to fix this
   problem, you need to edit the Makefile and add the dependent
   libraries to a compiler switch (or pass them on the
