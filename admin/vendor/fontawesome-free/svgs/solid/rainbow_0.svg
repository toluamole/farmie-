stashes it in L</meta> and returns
it as a hashref.  This is done so that the L<TAP::Parser::SourceHandler>s don't
have to repeat common checks.  Currently this includes:

    is_scalar => $bool,
    is_hash   => $bool,
    is_array  => $bool,

    # for scalars:
    length => $n
    has_newlines => $bool

    # only done if the scalar looks like a filename
    is_file => $bool,
    is_dir  => $bool,
    is_symlink => $bool,
    file => {
        # only done if the scalar looks like a filename
        basename => $string, # including ext
        dir      => $string,
        ext      => $string,
        lc_ext   => $string,
        # system checks
        exists  => $bool,
        stat    => [ ... ], # perldoc -f stat
